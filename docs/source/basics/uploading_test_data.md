# Uploading Test Data

When registering workflows, it is often desirable to upload sets of test data so
that users can quickly execute the workflow, inspect outputs, and get a feel for
what sample values could look like.

To this aim, the SDK provides the ability to define sets of sample parameter
values and to host example files.

The example files are hosted on AWS S3 and are publicly available for download.
Thus, they should only contain information that can be made publicly available.

## Defining Test Data

If we have a toy workflow:

```python
@workflow
def foo(a: int, b: string, c: LatchFile):
  ...
```

We can define some test data using a `LaunchPlan` like so:

```python
from latch.resources.launch_plan import LaunchPlan

LaunchPlan(
  foo, # Name of the workflow
  "Some Numbers", # Name of the set of test data
  {"a": 1, "b": "bar", "c": LatchFile("s3://latch-public/test-data/42/foo.txt")} # A mapping of parameter names to values
)
```

A `LaunchPlan` needs:

- The name of the workflow it describes.
- The name to describe the test data set (this will be displayed on the console).
- A mapping of parameter names to parameter values. These values will be filled
  in on the interface when a user selects this set of test data.

One just needs to re-register the workflow with this `LaunchPlan` defined in the
same file and the `LaunchPlan` name will show up under the "Use Test Data"
drop-down on the workflow parameters page.

## Hosting Test Files

Notice that in the above example, our test value for the `c` parameter is a
`LatchFile` that points to some file in S3. To upload your own example files so
that others can use them in their `LaunchPlan`s, we have provided utility
subcommands in the CLI.

The example files are hosted on AWS S3 and are publicly available for download.
Thus, they should only contain information that can be made publicly available.

```console
$ latch test-data upload README.md
Successfully uploaded to s3://latch-public/test-data/4107/README.md

$ latch test-data ls
Listing your managed objects by full S3 path.

        s3://latch-public/test-data/4107/README.md
        s3://latch-public/test-data/4107/traceback.txt

$ latch test-data remove README.md
```

After uploading a file, you can simply refer to it using a
`LatchFile("s3://your_path")` as in the example above.
