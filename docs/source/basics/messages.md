# Messages

Task executions produce logs, displayed on the Latch console to provide users visibility into their workflows. However, these logs tend to be terribly verbose. It's tedious to sift through piles of logs looking for useful signals; instead, important information, warnings, and errors should be prominently displayed. This is accomplished through the Latch SDK's new messaging feature.

```python
from latch import small_task
from latch.functions.messages import message

@small_task
def task():

    ...

    try:
        ...
    catch ValueError:
        title = 'Invalid sample ID column selected'
        body = 'Your file indicates that sample columns a, b are valid'
        message(typ='error', data={'title': title, 'body': body})

    ...
```

The `typ` parameter affects how your message is styled. It currently accepts three options:

- `info`
- `warning`
- `error`

The `data` parameter contains the message to be displayed. It's represented as a Python `dict` and requires two inputs,

- `title`: The title of your message
- `body`: The contents of your message

For more information, see `latch.functions.messages` under the API docs.
