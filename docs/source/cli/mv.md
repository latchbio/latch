# `latch mv`

The command `latch mv` allows files and directories to be moved within Latch remotely.

## Usage

```shell
latch mv [OPTIONS] src dest
```

Both `src` and `dest` must be [Latch URLs](../basics/latch_urls.md). If both `src` and `dest` are in the same workspace, this is effectively a renaming of `src` to `dest`.

### Supported Options

- `--help`: Show a help message and exit.

## Examples

```shell
$ latch mv latch://123.account/a.txt latch://123.account/b.txt
# renames a.txt to b.txt
$ latch mv latch://123.account/hello latch://456.account/bye
# moves /hello (in 123) to /bye (in 456) (cross-workspace move)
```
