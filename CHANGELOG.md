* The `latch develop` command, and with it an ecosystem supporting local
  development and faster debugging.
* The `latch cp` command now displays a x number of files out of n indicator
  and displays which stage of the download is going on (network request to get
  presigned urls vs downloading blob data).
* A new error that is thrown when there is an inconsistency between a
`LatchMetadata` object and its associated workflow's parameters.
* The function `get_secret` which allows users to reference secrets they've
  uploaded to the Latch platform from within a workflow.

  + force retry on connection closed on file uploads (POST requests more generally)
* `latch get-params` will escape class attribute names (representation of Enum
  type) if they are python keywords
* `latch preview` now requires a directory argument instead of a workflow name
  argument, and now behaves consistently with regular parameter interface
  generation.
* The crash reporter now prints stack traces of caught exceptions in the
  correct order
* `latch develop` now throws an error when run on a workflow that hasn't been
  registered yet.
* Reworked how internal configs are stored, eschewing a flat dictionary of API
  endpoints in favor of a nested dataclass. This removes a small class of
  potential mistakes arising from misspelling, and gives the benefit of IDE
  intellisense.
* Made both configs singletons.

## 2.10.1 - 2023-01-18

### Fixed

* Fixed issue with registering libraries containing nested imports used as
  subclasses (eg. `torch` )
