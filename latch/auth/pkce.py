class PKCE:
    """A Context manager to control state for PKCE flow.

    The Proof Key for Code Exchange is outlined rigorously in `RFC7636`_.  The
    implementation in this module was written using that document as gospel. It
    is an extension of OAuth2.0 that adds crytographic secrets to prevent
    request interception.

    Here is a diagram to summarize the flow (capital letters correspond to
    descriptions):

    A. The client creates and records a secret named the "code_verifier"
       and derives a transformed version "t(code_verifier)" (referred to
       as the "code_challenge"), which is sent in the OAuth 2.0
       Authorization Request along with the transformation method "t_m".

    B. The Authorization Endpoint responds as usual but records
       "t(code_verifier)" and the transformation method.

    C. The client then sends the authorization code in the Access Token
       Request as usual but includes the "code_verifier" secret generated
       at (A).

    D. The authorization server transforms "code_verifier" and compares
       it to "t(code_verifier)" from (B).  Access is denied if they are
       not equal.

    _An attacker who intercepts the authorization code at (B) is unable to_
    _redeem it for an access token, as they are not in possession of the_
    _"code_verifier" secret._
